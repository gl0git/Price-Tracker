# Price-Tracker
A simple app to notify you when the price drops on a given product

Disclaimer: This price tracker is for Amazon. But you can change that through changing the selected div's in the code for the variables "title" and "price."

There's a few things that need to be configured to use this (the blankspaces given for certain information).

You must add:
1) a URL to the product you'd like to track
2) your user-agent (just google "my user agent")
3) your email and APP password (https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
4) the email you'd like to send from, and the email you'd like to send to.
